# python_smart_terminal
What:
  This is a line oriented rs232 terminal developed for interaction with micro controllers like the arduino.  
  For much more info see http://www.opencircuits.com/Python_Smart_Terminal

Status: 
  Seems to be working well, actively working on parts of it for my dyslecic clock.
  as of Sept 2018 major revisions, contact me if you would like an update.
  Intended for those with some Python experience who can add the files to their Python development environment ( no install features for   this code ). Some dependencies will need to be installed, probably prompted by error messages. Editing of the parameter file 
  should be   easier for those with Python experience. Users should find some useful documentation in the code, this is still a work in     progress. Much code has been lifted from other projects of mine, some artifacts of the other projects remain.  Some unnecessary files
  left over from refactoring, will be removed soon.
  
Enviroment: 
* Program should run on any OS supporting Python 3.6. ( this is new, to let me use f"" in particular )
* This should include Windows, Mac, Linux, and Raspberry Pi.  
* So far tested on:
** Windows 
** Raspberry Pi ( need retest for python 3.6 coming soon.
** More coming... ( I do not have a mac )

	Note for contributers 
		Fixes would be great.
